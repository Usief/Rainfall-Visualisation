# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

The reason that I chose the rainfall dataset is I think this dataset is more
understandable for me and audiences. I try to show the relationship between the rainfall and the years in different locations. I highlight the data to green when the rainfall was higher than the average rainfall and yellow when the rainfall was lower than the average rainfall, so the audiences can have a more intuitive feel for the data.

Audiences can get an overview of the data and they also can find the details in a year according to the time and color changes. I hope the viewers can tell their friends that there are some dry seasons and flood seasons in the past. If they say the clock is interesting, I would be very happy.
