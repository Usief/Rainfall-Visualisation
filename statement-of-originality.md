# Statement of Originality

I <Yu Yang (u6412985)> declare that everything I have submitted in this
assignment is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

## Inspiration

The inspiration came from two parts. When I talked about this assignment with my friend, he said I could make a tachometer to represent the rainfall. I thought it was a good idea and I found the clock was similar with tachometer and it was better for this assignment. The second idea is from the website[1], when I searched creative data visualisation on Google. Both of the table and the clock contain circle, so I thought integrating them was a good idea. 

## Code

## Assets

I chose the <rainfall> dataset provided with the assignment 4 template repo.
